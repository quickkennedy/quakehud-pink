# quakehud

<a>INFO</a>
====
hi! my name is kennedy and i really like garm3nhud ql and wanted to improve it.<br>
here is a version of garm3nhud ql that is more towards the way i like huds to be, using fixes that hypnotize has put into some of their other updated huds.<br>
i hope to at some point do enough improvements to this hud to release it as my own hud and/or put these improvements into garm3nhud ql's repository.<br>
the changes would most likely not be put into the garm3nhud ql repository as they are changes that alter how the hud looks normally.<br>
if the changes were to be put into the garm3nhud ql repository, they would be added as customizations rather than being forced on the user.<br>
most of the work here is from garm3n and hypnotize, so they are credited first before myself.<br>
major changes include full linux support as well as a customizable font, but other more minor things have been added that you can see below.<br>

<a>UPDATE INFO</a>
====
here i've listed the updates that need to happen for each site the hud is on. this is because these platforms put my hud to the front page when i update, meaning its only ideal to update every once in a while rather than frequently. i will update gamebanana more than huds.tf, saving huds.tf updates for rare ocasions.

<a>LIST OF UPDATES GAMEBANANA IS BEHIND ON</a>
====
- targetid things
- item counters centered
- medic charge fixed

<a>LIST OF UPDATES HUDS.TF IS BEHIND ON</a>
====
- targetid things
- item counters centered
- medic charge fixed

<a>KNOWN BUGS</a>
====
- alternate ammo position is broken when using higher clip sizes (for example the snipers SMG)
- enabling then disabling streamer mode breaks many things
- loadout button overlaps with spectator health
- payload race elements overlap with damageaccount
